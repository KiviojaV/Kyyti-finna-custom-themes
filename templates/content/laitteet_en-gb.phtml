            <h3>Printing and Copying in Kouvola Libraries</h3>
            
            <p>All Kouvola libraries offer printing services that enable, for example, remote printing from your home computer and releasing print jobs at any Kouvola library.</p>
            <p><b>Register</b> before your first library print, copy, or scan by swiping your library card at the printer’s card reader and entering your card PIN.</p>
            <p><b>Printing and copying</b> are fee-based. Check the prices on the <a href="https://kyyti.finna.fi/Content/maksut-kouvola" target="_blank">Kouvola fees page</a>. You can print from a library computer or your own device. 
            Send your files from your email to kirjastotulostus[at]kouvola.fi. Your print job will be released at the library printer using your library card and PIN.</p>
            <p><b>Copying</b> requires a library card and its associated PIN.</p>
            <p><b>Scanning</b> is free. Send the scanned document from the device to your own email address.
                Printing and scanning require that your library card is registered with a PIN and that your email address is added to the library system.
                You can load funds onto your library card for printing and copying at the library’s customer service during opening hours.
